\chapter{Technical details}\label{ch:technical}
This chapter will revolve around the technical aspect of implementing the system used for the experiment. The first section will talk about the software, before the second section talk about the different hardware accessories that were designed and used.


\section{Application implementation}
With the framework decided we were able to start creating our system. 
Throughout the process of creating the application we focused on refactoring options, configurations and settings in each component into their own components. These options/settings would at a later stage be gathered together and some were exposed through the user interface in order to make it possible to change the behaviour of the application at runtime. The process of always putting all the configuration and options in the same place made it possible for the system to be extremely extendable and modifiable. 

\bigskip\noindent
The main part of the application were developed using javascript, HTML and CSS, as these are the primary technologies used when creating application with the Apache Cordova framework. We will therefore keep the focus on these technologies, even though some minor adjustments where done in the native android controller to enable a higher debugging level than the bluetooth plugin had originaly.

\bigskip\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:class} shows a simple "`class diagram"' of the application as it was when the project was coming to an end. Note that the term class diagram is not completely accurate as javascript is not a object oriented programming language in the same sense as Java, but utilizes prototypical inheritance to reuse common code components. The code for this application however isn't powered by a complicated class hierarchy and thus using the "`class diagram"' is sufficient to show how different components of the application interact.

\bigskip\noindent
The class diagram in figure~\ref{fig:class} shows a total of eighteen different javascript files, most of whom contain a single javascript "`class"', though some do contain several classes, but these classes are at an abstraction level below what should be exposed by the parent class. 

\bigskip\noindent
The main responsibilities of each class is shown in table~\ref{table:technical}.

		\textbf{*Simulator.js} & \wrap{Refers to all the differet simulators. These classes takes a RunnableProgram as the argument, and spins up the correct simulator. In cases where a robot is connected they also have the responsibility of sending the commands and keeping in sync with the robot.}{}\\
		\textbf{*Bluetooth.js} & \wrap{Refers to both bluetooth classes. Based on a debugging flag in the application one of these classes will be started. MockBluetooth will keep the same to the same interface as Bluetooth, but will use stubbing methods in order to provide a testing surface for the bluetooth functionality.}{}\\
		\textbf{ConnectionUI.js} & \wrap{The bluetooth connection user interface is dynamically injected if a bluetooth enabled device is detected by the application. The UI is maintained by this class.}{}\\

\section{Hardware accessories}
After the mainpart of the application was created we still had a lot of work ahead of us before we had a working prototype. In order to make the robot ready for the experiment we still missed the contraption which would handle the drawing with the physical robot, and the bluetooth modules that were to mounted on top of the robot. 

\subsection{Chassis modifications}
The problem we initially underestimated was how we should make the physical robot draw on paper. While a front or back mounted pen would be an easy solution this would not create the angles properly, and thus was not a real viable options. The clearence below the robot was to small for anything to fit underneath it, and the battery was placed in such a way that nothing could fit between the wheels of the robot (see figure~\ref{fig:robotUnder}). In order to fix this problem we designed a batteryholder which could be mounted on top of the robot (see figure~\ref{fig:batteryHolder}), but due to techinical problems witht the 3D printes we were not able to test this design. And we had to resort to an alternative solution using velcro to position the battery at the back of the robot and duct tape to add a counterweight at the front of the robot to provide stability (see figures in~\ref{fig:robot}). 

\bigskip\noindent
While this solved the problem of making room beneath the robot we still had multiple issues with getting the robot to draw properly. These issues were mainly due to inaccuracies in the 3D-printing environment meaning the the spring used to push the drawing tip into the paper would get snagged inside its container (figures~\ref{fig:pencilHolder} and~\ref{fig:pencilHolderReal}).

\subsection{Bluetooth circuit board}
The \chirp team had previously tested using bluetooth communication between an android device and the robot. We therefore got help in creating the inital circuitry for our bluetooth module(figure~\ref{fig:circuitDrawing}). This drawing was at this point designed in the Eagle software in order to make it possible to produce at a later stage(~\ref{fig:circuitDesign}). 

\bigskip\noindent
It can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:circuitProto} that some soldering around the board was necessary in the prototype. The prototype did however lead us to believe that the circuit itself was functional and we were able to proceed with creating all the circuit boards that we needed. 
Figure~\ref{fig:circuitTrans} shows the template used in the etching process when creating these boards. While figure~\ref{fig:circuitboard} shows the circuit board alongside with the bluetooth module we used for our robots. The complete assembly of the robot can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:robotDrawing}.
