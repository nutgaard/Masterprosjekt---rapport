\chapter{The design process}
	This chapter will outline the design principles and guidelines that were indentified in order to create all the necessary tools to complete this project. 
	First we will present the design principles alongside with why we felt these principles were important to this project.
	From these design principles we were able to reason about potensial system frameworks, which can be read about in section~\ref{sec:framework}.
	Though this chapter mainly talks about the software aspect of the system we feel that it is necessary to point out that the same principles were applied when designing hardware as well.
