\chapter{Design and development}
	This chapter will outline the design principles and guidelines that were indentified in order to create all the necessary tools to complete this project. 
	First we will present the design principles alongside with why we felt these principles were important to this project.
	From these design principles we were able to reason about potensial system architectures, this process can be read in section~\ref{sec:architectureReasoning}.
	The final architecture and design decision are shown in section{sec:technical}
