\chapter{Requirements}
	This chapter will outline the requirements that were indentified in order to create all the necessary tools to complete this project. 
	In broad strokes we have divided this chapter into two distinct, and somewhat disjunct part, software and hardware. 
	The first section will go through the requirements for the software, before continuing on to the section section which will be related to the hardware aspect of the project.
