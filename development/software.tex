\chapter{Software}\label{ch:software}
This chapter will talk about the software part of the project, how the design principles defined in chapter~\ref{ch:principles} was applied in order to solve the major obstacles before developing the application, and how the design principles helped us during the development. 

\bigskip\noindent
The first section will walk the reader through some of our keythoughs during the inital design phase of the application, and why we felt that our solutions fit within the bounderies of the design principles. 
Following this inital section we've dedicated a own section to the choice of base framework as this was one of the really major decisions during the development process and can in many cases make-or-break an application.
The second to last section will go into details about the technical aspect of the application, before we in the last section present the application as it was used during the experiments.

\section{Application of design principles}
In order to answer the questions proposed in the thesis while adhering to the design principles outlined we decided to utilize ideas from previous researchers within the field of educational robotics. 
One of the eariest researchers looking into how robotics could be used in schools and one of the creators of the Logo programming language were Seymour Papert (\cite{papert1980mindstorms}). Who has several decades of experience with using robots as a tool in education.
We therefore felt it natural to lean on this preexisting knowledge, and utilize the basis of Logo and its successors for our thesis. We felt this would give us a solid pedagogical fundation to start working with the application.
The full Logo language was however not needed for this project(and overly complex), in order to mitigate this we proposed a system where parts of the programming language can be disabled to make it easier for the participants to understand and grasp. In addition to basing much of the language of Logo we drew inspiration from MIT's scratch program\footnote{\url{http://scratch.mit.edu/about/}}, which is a programming tool based on predefined codeblocks. This removes the need for writing the correct syntax to make your program compile, and thus loweres the startup threshold for all participants. By utilizing a similar strategy to MIT would could allow the participants to create their program through a fully interactive graphics interface by dragging and dropping codeblocks into position. 

We proposed to create the system as a two component system, the \chirp robot and a programming device. 
As from the get-go we experienced trouble using the arduino integrated developer environment(AIDE), and determined that putting this system into the hands of non-technical personel would most likely deter people for using the system. 
As previous work with the robot had however shown that bluetooth was a viable option for communication between a mobile device and the robot(\cite{chrip2013ResearcherNight}), we found this to be a viable solution.
In addition a solution based on bluetooth communication would allow the system to be vastly more usable as we could remove the wired connections to a laptop, and defined our own interface in a language of our choice.
It was therefore decided that the system would use tablets(android, iPad, ect) as its programming device. This did however mean that we had to do alot of work on the application instead of reusing existing code from other projects. 

\bigskip\noindent
As the system was created to be used in an educational setting all the way down to lower parts of our educational system, 
we needed to make it easy to use for everyone, while still maintaining the complexity needed for children of an higher age and/or skillset. 
We wanted to create a system that could be used to teach fourth graders maths, and still be used to teach tenth graders programming at the same time. 
This reinforced the need for the system to be extendable, but also have an easy to use user interface. 
In order to solve this we proposed making several ways of creating the programs in the application, and making our programming modular so that subparts of the language could be disabled when not needed.
	
\section{Choice of framework}
	The first decision to be made were regarding the platform and how to achieve a crossplatform solution. 
	A native approach was quickly discarded as it would require multiple implementations in multiple languages (E.g. Objective-C for iOS devices, and Java for android devices, etc.). 
	Removing the native approach from our solution pool still left us with several options, including game frameworks and standardized cross platform tools.
	In a report by vision mobile in January 2013 they present a study involving six hundred developers and their preferences (\cite{developerCPT}). 
	In addition to the top five most used frameworks from vision mobile's report and some newer frameworks, we initially included game frameworks into the pool of frameworks. 
	The game frameworks were however discarded relativly fast as they rely heavily on custom built user interfaces and low level programming(openGL/webGL) for performance reasons.
	
	\bigskip\noindent
	After removing the game frameworks from our solution pool we looked throught the remaining options, PhoneGap(also known as Apache Cordova), Appcelerator, Adobe AIR, Sencha, Qt, DevExpress and Xamarin.

		\end{tabular}
	}
	
	\bigskip\noindent
	The framwork that had commercial licenses or a "`pay to use"' business model were removed from the list of potensial frameworks, which left us with the choice between Apache Cordova, Adobe AIR and Xamarin.
	We decided to move forward with PhoneGap due to language preferences in the team. Adobe AIR, while stating that one can use javascript, does in fact require the use of Flash and ActionScript for its mobile applications, and the we had very little experience with C\#.
	Apache Cordova on the other hand is build around standard web technologies as javascript, HTML and CSS, which both members of the project have been working with before.
	
\section{Technical details}
With the framework decided we were able to start creating our system. 
Throughout the process of creating the application we focused on refactoring options, configurations and settings in each component into their own components. These options/settings would at a later stage be gathered together and some were exposed through the user interface in order to make it possible to change the behaviour of the application at runtime. The process of always putting all the configuration and options in the same place made it possible for the system to be extremely extendable and modifiable. 

\bigskip\noindent
The main part of the application were developed using javascript, HTML and CSS, as these are the primary technologies used when creating application with the Apache Cordova framework. We will therefore keep the focus on these technologies, even though some minor adjustments where done in the native android controller to enable a higher debugging level than the bluetooth plugin had originaly.

\bigskip\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:class} shows a simple "`class diagram"' of the application as it was when the project was coming to an end. Note that the term class diagram is not completely accurate as javascript is not a object oriented programming language in the same sense as Java, but utilizes prototypical inheritance to reuse common code components. The code for this application however isn't powered by a complicated class hierarchy and thus using the "`class diagram"' is sufficient to show how different components interact.

\bigskip\noindent
The class diagram in figure~\ref{fig:class} shows a total of eighteen different javascript files, most of whom contain a single javascript "`class"', though some do contain several classes, but these classes are at an abstraction level below what should be exposed by the parent class. 

\bigskip\noindent
The main responsibilities of each class is shown in table~\ref{table:technical}.
