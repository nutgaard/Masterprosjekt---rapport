	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State Label all the point as core, border, or noise points.
		\State Eliminate noise points.
		\State Put an edge between all core points that are within $Eps$ of each other.
		\State Make each group of connected core points into a separate cluster.
		\State Assign each border point to one of the clusters of its associated core points.
