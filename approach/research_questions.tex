\chapter{Research questions}
We have found a couple of research questions through an initial literature study. We propose to create an intuitive platform for learning math with robotics that take the emphasis of programming.

\begin{description}
	\item[RQ1: ] Can using robotics in school help students understand what an angle is and aid in their angle estimation skills?
	\item[RQ2: ] What are the strength and weaknesses of using a robot compared to a simulated environment?
\end{description}
