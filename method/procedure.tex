\section{Procedure}
The study was divided into two sessions, one held on a Friday and one on the following Monday. The first session lasted 40 minutes and the second session lasted 45 minutes. 
%We also gave hints about the tasks, yet only when required by the students themselves or if they were stuck on a problem for far too long. 

%We never gave them the answers or any code, we merely said it might help if they go through the program block by block and think about what will happen to the robot, or asked them to show us which angle they were measuring and why they were measuring that angle. 

Each session consisted of an introduction to the subject, followed by a set of 10 difficulty increasing robot exercises. 
During the exercise phase the students worked on their own, while we acted as tutors, solving doubts regarding software and the activity itself. If groups were stuck on a single task without making progress we provided subtle hints to help them along. 
We never gave them the answers or any code, but explained that visualizing the program block by block and think about the effects on the robot. If it was clear that they measured the wrong angle we helped them get on the right track by having them explain how the robot moved. 
Other than this the students received no external help or instruction. The exercises was designed so that everyone should be able to do something, but no one should be able to do everything. 

One of the groups had to use a phone instead of a tablet due to unavailability of one tablet. 
The only difference of our application when used on a phone compared to a tablet is a smaller screen, and it did not seem to make a difference, at least not on the robot group, as they don't use the simulator, which is the part requiring a larger screen. 

\paragraph{First lecture}
In the first lecture, the robotic activity was the first learning activity that the students in the experimental group did on that day. 
%This may have a positive effect on their learning. 
The control group did other activities with the teacher, not related to our work, before working with the activities. 

\bigskip\noindent
The content in the first ten minutes was exactly the same. First an introduction of how the application works, then an introduction to supplementary angles and reflex angles. Next followed a 32 minutes session where the students experimented with the robot / simulator and attempted to create paths that were depicted in a task sheet. The tasks are included as appendix~\ref{appendix:experiment1}.
The exercises of the first session were relatively easy, since their main purpose was for the students to familiarize with the technology.
Only open polygons, or paths, where you don't end up where you started, were used in the first lecture exercises. This was done so that students would not get caught up in the precision of the robot or the length of movement.
The tasks met our expectations, as everyone managed at least four tasks and the best group finished the last task right before the session ended. When solving these tasks, the students were allowed to use protractors and pens. 

%\bigskip\noindent
%During the introduction we explained that they had to cooperate and let everyone try at some point. They should also try to understand why the program did not work before trying a new solution to avoid an trial and error approach.

\paragraph{Second lecture}
When teaching, one always does better the second time.
Therefore the control group started first in the second lecture.
The session was the first learning activity that the students in the simulator group did on that day. 
%This may have a positive effect on their learning. 
The robotics group had physical education before we swapped groups.

\bigskip\noindent
The second lecture started with a small recap on what we did last time. Then followed a short talk introducing regular polygons. We mentioned that, in order to complete a shape and make the robot end up where it started, it needs to turn all the way around during one program run. The students understood that this meant turning $360\,^{\circ}$. The recap focused on supplementary and reflex angles. Then followed 45 minutes of robot / simulator task solving activity. The tasks are included as appendix~\ref{appendix:experiment2}.
In the second session every exercise was a closed shape, and the students had be careful of how far the robot moved in forward or backward block. 
As in the first lecture the tasks we created for the second lecture also met our expectations, as everyone managed at least four tasks and the best group finished the last task right before the session ended.
