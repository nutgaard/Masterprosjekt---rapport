\chapter{Participants}
To analyse our research questions, we tested the robots with a group of fifth-grade students from the international school in trondheim(THIS). The study was carried out over two sessions with a weekend in between. A group of 15 students (4 boys and 11 girls) was selected from a group of 20 to work with the Robotics activity. 3 of the 20 students went on vacation during the experiment period. 2 of the 20 did a full score on the pretest and explained how everything worked very well in the how did you manage sections, and thus did not have much to learn. The teacher suggested that we don’t include these as instead of the robot activity teaching students the material they might do so with their own ideas. It turned out that we could not acquire enough tablets for that many groups anyways without having many 3 groups, so they were dropped as well. All the students were in the same class and either 10 or 11 years old. They had been taught about angles one month prior to our arrival using a traditional blackboard based teaching scheme. Thus every student had prior knowledge of angles and angle estimation. The next thing they were going to learn was about reflex angles and area of shapes. None of the students had worked with this specific kind of technology before.  

They were chosen because they were the only ones we could get. Them or nothing. We originally wanted students who knew nothing or little, or at least it had been a while since learned about angles. So 5th grade would have been perfect if we had gotten there one month earlier.
