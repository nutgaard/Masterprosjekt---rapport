The inspiration behind the study was a wish to test the robot as an educational tool in an experimental classroom setup. We wished to increase students' understanding of angles and their angle estimation skills. We also wished to increase the students' cooperation and motivation. As we mentioned in chapter~\ref{chap:constructionism}, the pedagogic theory we rely on is constructionism, which is quite different from the blackboard and task driven mathematics education, which according to \tcite{alseth2003endringer} happens in most of the classrooms in Norway, including the classrooms at THIS. %When we talked to the teacher at THIS, it seemed like this is the prevalent method there as well.
