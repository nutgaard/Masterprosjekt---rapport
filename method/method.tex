\chapter{Research Methodology}
The inspiration behind the study was a wish to test the robot as an educational tool in an experimental classroom setup. We wish to increase students motivation and cooperation. This setup is quite different from regular mathematics teaching, like traditional blackboard teaching or task and book driven approach, which according to (referance from W\ae ge) happens in most of the classrooms in Norway. When we talked to the teacher at THIS, it seemed like this is the prevalent method there as well. Whatever the teaching case might be, at least the students have not experienced an experimental teaching method yet.
