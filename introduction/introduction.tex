After the technology boom in the 20th century, technology have become extremely important, and thus so have science, engineering and mathematics. It is therefore vital to adapt a continuous effort to improving the education provided within these fields. However from the year 2000 up to 2012, the PISA tests showed a decrease in the average score on the mathematics test (from 500 to 494) overall in Europe~\cite{OECDPISA2000, OECDPISA2012}. This is also visible in the Norwegian results, indicating a decrease from 499 in 2000 to 489 in 2012 within mathematics and generally a lower score then our neighbouring countries~\cite{OECDPISA}.
%Schools have problems with keeping students engaged and motivated in courses related to science, and especially in mathematics. 
%Norwegian students also perform poorly compared the students in the neighboring countries in these courses~\cite{OECDPISA}.
%They also perform poorly to a large extent.

In 1980 Seymour Papert published the book ``Mindstorms: Children, computers, and powerful ideas''\cite{papert1980mindstorms}, where his ideas of an alternative 
learning environment, which utilizes robotics were presented. It was Papert's belief that educational robotics held a major potential improvement of the current learning environment.
Allowing children to interact and construct their their own knowledge in ways previously impossible. 
This book was the start of educational robotics and many researchers rely on the early work conducted by Seymour Papert within educational robotics. However, they often fail to explain how Papert's theories are applied within their own research. 

\bigskip\noindent
In the later years robotics has seen a huge increase within domestic use, and have now become an affordable tool in the daily life of most people~\cite{kara2003sizing,hsiu2003designing}.
A lot of research has been done to show that robotics can be beneficial in an educational setting.
The majority of research into educational robotics shows that gains in content knowledge can be achieved using robotics.

%Many mention Papert, but fail to explain how their approach relates to his theories of learning.
%They merely state that Papert was an influence or that they use experimental design inspired by Papert's work. %, but this is only a small part of Papert's vision.

%What we have implemented is designed in a way for other students to expand on. We are taking the first step. It is always the hardest. 
%There is also help in the literature but limited in this area. 
%We successfully created contact with them and will hopefully create a cooperation with the ChIRP group for future research.
