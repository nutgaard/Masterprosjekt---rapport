\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis serves as an introduction into the school world for the robot team at IDI. A lot of groundwork had to be done in order to carry out this simple experiment. A focus has been kept on future work and creating everything easily modifiable. 

A big lack in the research is an answer to why robotics are a good choice for use in schools. Many mention papert but fail to continue with this thread. They merely say that this was an influence or that they use experimental design which is only a part of Paperts vision. We focus very much on paperts theories of mental model building. We want to test whether relatability can be improved by using a robot instead of the turtle graphics style simulator with a turtle moving on the screen. 

What we are doing is the first thesis in this area in the team and that is hard. We are breaking new ground for the team, establishing collaborations and providing the basis for future work. What we have implemented is designed in a way for other students to expand on. We are taking the first step. It is always the hardest. There is also help in the literature but limited in this area.
