\chapter{Introduction}
Schools have problems with keeping students engaged and motivated in maths lessons. They also perform poorly to a large extent. The robotics business is growing all the time and robotics in education has been shown to have great promise. The focus of this project is to investigate the potential of robotics in schools and expand the robotics team at IDI into the world of education. This thesis serves as an introduction into the school world for the robotics team at IDI. A lot of groundwork had to be done in order to carry out this experiment. Thus there has been a focus throughout this project on how it can be made applicable to future work.

\bigskip\noindent
A lot of research has been done to show that robotics can be beneficial in an educational setting. 
Many mention Papert, but fail to explain how their approach relates to his theories of learning.
They merely say that Papert was an influence or that they use experimental design, but this is only a small part of Papert's vision. 
Another common sight while reading about educational robotics is lack of research regarding the usefulness of physical robots in itself. 
While still basing our approach on Papert's theories of mental model building. We want to test whether relatability and knowledge gains can be improved by using a physical robot compared to using a simulator confined to a local device.

\bigskip\noindent
What we are doing is the first thesis in this area in the team and that is hard. We are breaking new ground for the team, establishing collaborations and providing the basis for future work. What we have implemented is designed in a way for other students to expand on. We are taking the first step. It is always the hardest. There is also help in the literature but limited in this area. 

All we have done leads up to a pilot test at THIS. We successfully created contact with them and will hopefully create a cooperation with the ChIRP group for future research.
