\section{Project Goals}
The goal of this project is to investigate the use of robotics in schools for the ChIRP group. We will implement an intuitive way to control the robot with a solid foundation in pedagogic theory, make necessary alterations to the ChIRP and test our assumptions on school children. There will not be enough time to fully test this system but it will serve as a platform for others to expand on in the future. 

We will also try to document our design choices and break down the pedagogic theories and relating work through a literature study to support our choices and claims to create a solid platform. 

We wish to contribute to the discussion of educational robotics both through our software implementations but also the conclusions we draw on robot vs simulator. In this way we intend to further the research in this area.
