\section{Project Goals}
The goal of this project is to investigate the use of robotics in schools for the ChIRP group. We aim to implement an intuitive way to control the robot with a solid foundation in pedagogic theory. This will require customizations to the ChIRP robot and to test our assumptions with school children. There will not be enough time to fully test this system but it will serve as a platform, provide guidelines and pitfalls for others to expand on in the future. 

%\bigskip\noindent
%We will also try to document our design choices and break down the pedagogic theories and relating work through a literature study to support our choices and claims to create a solid platform. 
\bigskip\noindent
In the end we wish to contribute to the discussion of educational robotics both through our software implementations but also the conclusions we draw on robot versus simulator. In this way we intend to further the research in this area. 

%\bigskip\noindent
%The end goa	l of the project is to provide more empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of educational robotics, and perhaps an alternative solution to using expensive and commercial robots.
