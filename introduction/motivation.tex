\section{Motivation}
The majority of research into educational robotics shows that gains in content knowledge can be achieved using robotics. 
%Robotics are proven to be good and sometimes bad. 
However the benefits of a robot in education discussed in several papers often limit themselves to only talking about superficial aspects like fun, engagement, motivation and cooperation. 
%We want to take a closer look at why, and one of the major issues identified during a literature review was the lack of research into simulated environments. 
We want to take a closer look into the pedagogic aspects of mental model building (intellectual model building) and investigate the differences in using a physical robot compared to a simulator which is significantly cheaper to develop, buy and maintain.% a robot is better (if that is the case) than for example a simulator which is significantly cheaper to develop, buy and maintain. 

\bigskip\noindent
We find that besides mental model building which might be improved by using robots the learning experience will most definitely be new and interesting. We see this as an important aspect of the robotics experience, and therefore aim to augment our investigation to include questions that probe for attitude changes. 

%\bigskip\noindent
%Present our literature study findings. Should literature study come before the task itself?
%Nah, blir ikke det feil?
