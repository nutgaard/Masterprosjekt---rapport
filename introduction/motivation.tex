\section{Motivation}
Robotics are proven to be good and sometimes bad. However the benefits of a robot in education discussed in several papers often limit themselves to talking about superficial aspects like fun, engagement, motivation and cooperation. We want to look deeper into the pedagogic aspects of mental model building (intellectual model building) and investigate why a robot is better (if that is the case) than for example a simulator which is significantly cheaper to develop, buy and maintain. 

\bigskip\noindent
We find that besides mental model building which might be improved by using robots the learning experience will most definitely be new. We will look for motivation, fun etc. 

\bigskip\noindent
Present our literature study findings. Should literature study come before the task itself?
