\section{Questionaire}
Overall the questionaire did not yield very significant results. There was about the same spread in both robot and simulation group. Surprisingly there was a difference in question 17: Do you think imagining a robot turning can help you when working with angles? For the robot group 2 answered 0 and 2 answered + giving a total score of 2. In the simulator group 3 answered ++ and 1 answered + giving a total score of 7. This is the main factor we thought would be prevalent in the robot group. As seen in figure~\ref{fig:questionare} there was a slightly higher score for the robot group in the questions regarding interest, motivation and entertainment value when summed together. Question 15 and 16 scored the same for both groups.
