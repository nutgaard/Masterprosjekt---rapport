\chapter{Results}
In order to determine each students level of understanding and knowledge prior to the experiment, seven days before the first stession, a pretest was preformed using the test created in collaboration with the class' teacher~(Appendix~\ref{appendix:pretest}). 
The same test, augmented by a short questionaire was used for the posttest~(Appendix~\ref{appendix:posttest}).
For the inital analysis of the data we used a independent-samples t-test in order to determine if there was any
significant difference in the gains between the results of the robotics group and the simulator group (chapter~\ref{ch:independentttest}).
This analysis was followed by a paired t-test analysis within each group 
to determine if there was a significant increase between the pretest scores and posttest scores (chapter~\ref{ch:pairedttest}).
Finally in chapter~\ref{ch:additionalTests}, "`\nameref{ch:additionalTests}"', we have included a set of additonal test,
where we further analyse the dataset to see if any significant connections can be found. 

\bigskip\noindent
All the following chapters(chapter~\ref{ch:independentttest}, \ref{ch:pairedttest} and \ref{ch:additionalTests}) have utilized different analyses, but share a common structure in how they are presented.
They start with the assumptions related to each analysis, if assumptions are violated, appropriate meaures are used to show that the violation itself does not affect the resulting outcome.
At the very end they all end with a small summary of the analysis. 
The very last chapter (chapter~\ref{ch:cronbach}) in this part of the report shows the Cronbach's alpha analysis for measuring the internal consistency reliability and test-retest analysis using Pearson's product-moment correlations between pretest and posttest scores to measure the stability reliability.

\bigskip\noindent
For simplicity and readability we've included a small table with some of the statistics from the different analyses here.
