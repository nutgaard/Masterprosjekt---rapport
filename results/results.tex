\chapter{Results}
In order to determine each students level of understanding and knowledge prior to the experiment, seven days before the first stession, a pretest was preformed using the test created in collaboration with the class' teacher~(Appendix~\ref{appendix:pretest}). 
The same test, augmented by a short questionaire was used for the posttest~(Appendix~\ref{appendix:posttest}).
For the inital analysis of the data we used a independent-samples t-test.
