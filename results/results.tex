\chapter{Results}
In order to determine each students level of understanding and knowledge prior to the experiment, seven days before the first stession, a pretest was preformed using the test created in collaboration with the class' teacher~(Appendix~\ref{appendix:pretest}). 
The same test, augmented by a short questionaire was used for the posttest~(Appendix~\ref{appendix:posttest}).
For the inital analysis of the data we used a independent-samples t-test in order to determine if there was any
significant difference between the results of the robotics group and the simulator group (chapter~\ref{ch:independentttest}).
This analysis was followed by a paired t-test analysis within each group 
to determine if there was a significant increase between the pretest scores and posttest scores (chapter~\ref{ch:pairedttest}).
Finally a chapter~\ref{ch:additionalTests}, \nameref{ch:additionalTest}, include a set of additonal test.
