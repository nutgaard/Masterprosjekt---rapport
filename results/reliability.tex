\chapter{Cronbach's Alpha}
In order to measure the internal consistency (reliability) of the pretest and posttest we used Cronbach's Alpha as a measurement. 
The pretest and posttest was divided into six different scales, measuring
basic understanding of angles, sizes of inner angles, sizes of reflex angles, sizes of complementary angles and angles in shapes, understanding of the robot turning, and maths involving angles. A list of tasks and the categoriy they affect is listed in table~\ref{table:testCategories}. 

\bigskip\noindent
The task indicators, \texttt{q1..q24}, refer to the tasks in the pretest and posttest where the participants could score point. The first task, \texttt{q1}, would be the second task on the pretest; \textit{draw an angle}. The fourth task on the pretest include five subtasks, these are represented as the task indicators \texttt{q3} to \texttt{q7}, and so on.
The same categories were used for the posttest as well with task indicators from \texttt{qq1} to \texttt{qq24} to avoid any confusion.

\bigskip\noindent
Table~\ref{table:cronbachPretest} and \ref{table:cronbachPosttest} shows the Cronbach's alpha for eachs of these categories for the pretest and posttest respectively. We've added a column for describing other noteworthy observations during this analysis as well. 
The cronbach's alpha for the whole pretest was $\alpha = 0.812$, for the posttest $\alpha = 0.860$, and for all tests results $\alpha = 0.908$. All of which were above the $0.7$ threshold as recommended by \cite{devellis2003scale} and \cite{kline2005principles}.
