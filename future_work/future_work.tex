\section{Future work}
The main lack in research at this moment is a large scale study over a long time period. We also propose a project testing either the robotics activities or simulator activities vs a regular school curriculum over a longer time period. 
The student tasks in another experiment should take into consideration the problems we have encountered. 
The student tasks could be created with more complex goals, maybe something requiring a whole lesson to solve. 
Students should be put in a position where they have to explain their approach and reasoning about their solutions, and specific group roles should be created so that one student cannot dominate the experimentation experience of all the other students. 
For future projects more of the \chirp functionality should be used, including its distance sensor functionality and possibly create new extensions for use in schools.
For such projects the chassis might need further improvements to the chassis, and we would suggest altering the entire chassis for such purposes, as the process of adapting extensions for the existing chassis proved difficult.
