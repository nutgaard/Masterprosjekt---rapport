\section{Future work}
Improve the chassis for more advanced projects.

We propose a project testing either the robotics activities or simulator activities vs a regular school curriculum over a longer time period. 

A larger study is also required. 

Tasks could be created with more complex goals, maybe something requiring a whole lesson to solve.
