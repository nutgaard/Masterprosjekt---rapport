\section*{Abstract}
	Datawarehouseing, datamining, and big data has become common words throughout the later years. 
	The goals of this project is to look into these fields, and provide an introductory study of how
	techniques from these fields can help utilize idle data by creating a predictive system in regards to student dropout. 
	We describe why this is important and provide a proposition as to how such a system may be designed, and possible
	advantages and disadvantages.
