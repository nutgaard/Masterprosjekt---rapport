\section*{Discussion}
In this section we discuss the results obtained in an attempt to answer the three questions presented in section~\ref{sec:questions}.

\subsection*{Which topics within math are taught through robotics in schools?}
\tcite{mitnik2009collaborative} graph construction and interpretation skills.

\bigskip\noindent
\tcite{norton2004using} Ratio concepts. 

\bigskip\noindent
\tcite{silk2011resources} Proportional reasoning.

\subsection*{How effective has these inquires been?}
Just because the math is present in an activity, it doesn't mean that students will learn math \tcite{silk2011resources}. This dissertation looks mostly at how the lessons have to designed to generalize the knowledge students attain.

Students using robots achieve a significant increase in their graph interpreting skills. It is twice as effective as an alternative simulation activity \tcite{mitnik2009collaborative}. This seems like a promising result and should be tested further. 

The link between activities and the underlying math must be made very explicit. 





\subsection*{Which, if any, secondary skills (teamwork, scientific inquiry etc) may also be improved through the utilization of robotics in education?}

Teamwork \cite{mitnik2009collaborative, }
