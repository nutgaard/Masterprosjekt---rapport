\section*{Method}
This review has been completed as several phases, all based upon the Kitchenham's guide for writing systematic reviews\cite{kitchenham2007guidelines}. The initial steps of identifying a need for the review and commissioning a review have however been omitted here. The steps followed is written down below.

\subsection*{Planning the review}
Initially, we preformed an inital general search into educational robotics, in order to obtain some fundemental knowledge regarding this subject. In this search we stumbled upon another review written in 2011 by Fabiane Barreto Vavassori Benitti\cite{Benitti2012978}, which to a very large extend covers the same topic as initially planned by this review. There is however some minor differences between our research question, papers relevant to Benitti will to a large extend be relevant for this review as well.
