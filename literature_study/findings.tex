	\tcite{hussain2006effect} & 322 pupils in robotics group, 374 pupils as control group. \textbf{Quantitative}: pre/post-test compared with control group using a generalized linear model. \textbf{Qualitative}: observation, interview, and inquiry. & Positive returns for 5th graders math knowledge, while no returns in 9th grade. No significant returns regarding problem-solving skills was found in 5th or 9th grade. \\\hline
	
	\tcite{lindh2007does} & 322 pupils in robotics group, 374 pupils as control group. \textbf{Quantitative}: different tests in mathematics and problem solving using ANOVA test. \textbf{Qualitative}: observation, interview, and inquiry. &  No statistical evidence that the average pupil benefits from robotics. Further analysis showed that the medium scoring students did however benefit from the tutoring. \\\hline
	
	\tcite{barker2007robotics} & 14 pupils in robotics group, 18 pupils as control group. \textbf{Quantitative}: pre/post-test of non-random assigned pupils. & FINDINGS \\\hline
	\tcite{nugent2009use} & 147 pupils in robotics group, 141 pupils as control group. \textbf{Quantitative}: quasi-experimental pre/post-test of children at summer camp. Analyzed using ANCOVA/split plot ANOVA. & FINDINGS \\\hline
	
	\tcite{mitnik2008autonomous} & Three different pairs of groups, with 12, 14, and 12 as the robotics group. And 6, 15, and 11 as the control groups. \textbf{Quantitative}: pre/post-test scheme of non-random assignment. \textbf{Qualitative}: observations  & FINDINGS \\\hline
	
	\tcite{nugent2008effect} & 38 pupils attending a summer camp, no control group. \textbf{Quantitative}: pre/post-test using the same assessment in both cases. Analysis done using t-tests. & FINDINGS \\\hline
	
	\tcite{williams2007acquisition} & 21 pupils attending a summer camp, no control group. \textbf{Quantitative}: pre/post-test using the same assessment in both cases.  & FINDINGS \\\hline
