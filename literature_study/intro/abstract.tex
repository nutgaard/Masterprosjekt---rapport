\section*{Abstract}
	In the later years robotics has seen a huge increase within domestic use, and have now become an affordable tool in the daily life of most people~\cite{kara2003sizing,hsiu2003designing}.
	Yet robotics has only seen minimal use within an educational setting. Some researchers suggest that this may be due to the lack of empirical evidence
	supporting benefits of educational robotics~\cite{williams2007acquisition}. 
	The goal of this report is therefore to 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item look at how robotics can be utilized in an educational setting to promote STEM content knowledge and STEM attitude
		\item create a systematic review of the current available evidence regarding this topic
		\item propose future research
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\bigskip\noindent
	After finding a lot of papers relevant to these questions, we analyzed the content and purpose of each study.
	The reviewed articles suggest that educational robotics usually results in an increase of content knowledge and a more positive attitude towards STEM. 
	Though there were also studies that reported that educational robotics did not yield any tangiable results. 
	The studies that reported negative (no increase in content knowledge) do however form the minorty out of all the studies reviewed.
