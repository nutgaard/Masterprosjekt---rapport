\section*{Introduction}
In the later years robotics has seen a huge increase within domestic use, and have now become an affordable tool in the daily life of most people.
In 1980 Seymour Papert published the book "`Mindstorms: Children, computers, and powerful ideas"'\cite{papert1980mindstorms}, where his ideas of a constructionismistic 
learning environment and robotics were presented. It was Papert's belief that educational robotics held a major potential improvement of the current learning environment.
Allowing children to interact and construct their their own knowledge in way previously impossible. 

\bigskip\noindent
Even though educational theorists believed robotics could be utilized in a learning environment with success, there has been little
incorporation of seen throuhout the world. 
Some speculate that the limited adoption is due to lack of empirical evidence for the effect of robotics as a learning tool\cite{williams2007acquisition}.
