\subsubsection{Previous work}
A systematic review on this subject have already been conducted by Fabiane Barreto Vasassori Benitti in 2011\cite{Benitti2012978}. The review tried to answer 3 questions in general, namely:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What topics are taught through robotics in schools
  \item How is student learning evaluated
  \item Is robotics an effective tool for teaching?
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip\noindent
Question 1 and 3 in particular are interesting for us. 
Four criteria for exclusion (EC) were also identified:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Aimed at teaching of robotics, i.e. robotics is the subject of the learning and not a teaching tool
  \item Article does not provide a quantitative assessment of learning. If an article presented only interviews, observation and motivating
analysis, then it was excluded.
  \item It did not show the use of robots, involving automated equipment or simulation environments with robots
	\item The article was considered out of context, addressing undergraduate education (the focus of study is elementary, middle and high
school), or it reports the design of robots, among other aspects.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip\noindent
This is the same exclusion criteria we would have used as well, except maybe EC2. There were 60 papers excluded by EC2 and if we need more specific examples we might look into those. At this time however we did not see the need to carry out a systematic review ourselves as we partially wonder how effective robots in education will be in a quantitative way as well. 

\bigskip\noindent
Other papers have however been located by reading the papers that has cited this paper and using google scholar with keywords education and robot.

Write more about the other papers we selected here.
