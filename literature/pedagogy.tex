\chapter{Constructionism}
Constructionism is a pedagogical theory. It was created by Seymore Papert. It is inspired by the constructivist theory of knowledge. This constructivist model can be summarized in a single statement: Knowledge is constructed in the mind of the learner \cite{bodner1986constructivism}. It argues that knowledge cannot simply be transferred from the teacher to the students but that individuals create mental models to understand the world around them. These mental models are created from an interaction between their experiences and their ideas in an iterative process called assimilation. When we assimilate we incorporate the new experience into an already existing framework without changing that framework. 

\bigskip\noindent
Papert describes the difference as: ``From constructivist theories of psychology we take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing is a meaningful product''. The main difference is that where Piaget would explain the slower development of a particular concept by its greater complexity or formality, Papert see the critical factor as the relative poverty of the culture in those materials that would make the concept concrete and simple.

\bigskip\noindent
The main pedagogical theory used in educational robotics is Constructionism. In fact, every single paper we have read have either used this pedagogical theory or no pedagogical theory at all. To aid the reader this is discussed before state of the art, so that we may draw conclusions in a more intuitive way. We base this discussion on the book Mindstorms: Children, computers, and powerful ideas\cite{papert1980mindstorms} by Seymore Papert. The book was the first big publication about this topic and introduces Constructionism. The book is really about how an idea, a way of thinking, comes to inhabit a young mind.

\bigskip\noindent
The reason Constructionism fits educational robotics so well is because either you construct a robot or use a robot to construct other things, and that is why we have chosen to use this theory as so many before us. Drawing on Constructionism in this project has two major implications, experimental design and intellectual model building. 

\section{Intellectual model building}
Intellectual models means the structures we have in our mind that we use when we perform tasks such as mathematics for example. Seymore wrote that through his childhood he used gears as a mental model, even though he didn't know it at that time. When he was in school and they learned a new concept like multiplication for example, he would find a way to relate this to the gears. These mental models are usually found individually and is often something a person finds interesting. Not everybody find mental models that they can relate to by the time they start in school. One of the goals with constructionism is to help these students by providing a culture that is rich in materials students can build mental models around to make new concepts concrete and simple. Like other builders, children use the materials they find about them. In \cite{papert1980mindstorms} Papert introduces the turtle as one such material. He introduces and tested the turtle as both a robot and a simulator. In regards to mental models he meant that there was no difference between the robot and the simulator. The turtle is described as an ``object to think with''. This object does not have to be a turtle, it can be anything, in our case a robot. Through creating ``works of art'' with the robot, students need to think about how to make the robot move in a certain pattern. Because they have to program the robot to move it, they have to reflect upon how they themselves think. 

\bigskip\noindent
The main example concept used throughout the book is geometry. The turtle can help make geometry simple to learn. Unlike a point which is a very abstract thing, a turtle has (like us) a position and a direction. The students can relate to this turtle and hopefully create a mental model around it, using it and turning in their heads when they need to do something. 

\bigskip\noindent
Mental models assist us in problem solving. As we experiment with new concepts, our understanding and mental models are changed by our surroundings. Mental models are always adapting through what Piaget called assimilation. Our mental models are never complete, but constantly evolving to fit new scenarios. A mental model is a very simplified explanation of a complex phenomena. It contains errors and contradictions. However when we face these contradictions, that is when we evolve. We try to reason and make sense of what is happening. For example when teachers try to teach physics in a traditional blackboard approach, there is usually a bunch of rules and shortcuts in the curriculum, so that students can start working on simplified problems. These rules resembles what happens in our minds, but when teachers feed us these rules they are not our own, they are someone else's way of explaining what is happening. These rules are not easily understood by everyone. When constructing the models on your own, maybe reinforced by the rules afterward they will become stronger and everyone can make the connections that suits them. 

\section{Experimental design}
Normally when using computers or robots in education we make the computer ``program'' the child by asking questions, showing them something on the screen etc. This is also how the regular blackboard and task solving approach of teaching works. In constructionism, teaching ``at'' students is replaced by assisting them to understand while they experiment on certain tasks, for example programming the computer or the robot. This is done to make students explore and reflect on how they think. They have to think about what instructions to give the robot so that it will behave in the way they want. In addition to this thinking process, when programming the computer the child acquires a sense of mastery over a modern powerful technology. When programming the children learn mathematics as a living language by learning to ``talk'' to a computer. Papert compares this to learning french while living in France, compared to learning french in french class. In this way we learn how to learn and love math. We continually use math in a way that feels useful, and we avoid math being experienced as a abstract concept that students feel they will never have any use for. 

\bigskip\noindent
Experimental design is often described as ``learning without a curriculum''. Seymore said ``Of course the turtle can help in the teaching of traditional curriculum, but I have thought of it as a vehicle for piagetian learning, which to me is learning without curriculum''.

Constructionism calls for a change in the classroom dynamic and curriculum. Teaching without curriculum in this context means supporting children as they build their own intellectual structures with materials drawn from the surrounding culture.

Active creators of our own knowledge. To do this we must ask questions, explore and assess what we know. We are trying to do by making students do tasks, without too much available pre information. This builds on the intellectual models. 

\bigskip\noindent
This is sort of a guided discovery. Tasks are set out in order for students to hopefully understand how they got the answers by themselves. Teachers avoid most direct instruction, but rather lead the students on a journey through questions, activities, discussions and try to make them verbalize with their discoveries in the correct way.
