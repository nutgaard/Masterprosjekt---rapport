\section{Which questions remain to be answered?}
Not many propose future work that does not include the same setup but with larger scale testing. Our concerns are:

Why should we use robots and not a simulator?
Does a physical robot provide a better basis for intellectual model building?
How should the effectiveness of educational robotics be tested in a specific area within mathematics? not many papers include their tests or the reasoning behind them. No pedagogical expertise is taken into account either.
