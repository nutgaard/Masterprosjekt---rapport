-\chapter{Choice of methods}
-Most research methods can be placed in one of two categories: quantitative or qualitative methods. Qualitative research is often used to get an insight into how students perceive something, and their thoughts and feelings about the subject. It is also used to understand their behavior. Quantitative methods have a focus on finding the general correlations, and discover tendencies that give interesting insights for future research or can be supported through other methods. This is done by pointing out special factors that are the cause of a given tendency \cite{tjora2012kvalitative}. If you want a broad understanding of a phenomenon you should use quantitative methods. Testing a hypothesis statistically is an example of quantitative research methods.

-\section{Test}

 Tests are commonly used  in schools to find out what the students know and what they have learned. All the papers presented in the pre study applied a pretest and a posttest to support their findings, as this was one of the inclusion criteria. 
 %We wanted statistically significant results to support our decisions.

+One advantage of using a test is that students are used to being tested in this manner. It is relatively efficient to get an overview of what the students know, or don't know and what they have learned. This is because a test can be distributed to several students at the same time.
 
 \bigskip\noindent
 Using tests alone has limitations to what can be measured. It is hard to test for deeper kinds of knowledge, as test questions often have only one right answer. It only test whether students know the answer or not, even though they might have managed the task with a little help. For example if a student did not understand the question due to language limitations. With this in mind the question about tests are: does this test really reflect what they understand and what is outside their understanding \cite{andersen2009evaluering}. A way to work around this would be to include several items in the test that measures the same underlying knowledge. Interview or an oral test can also be used in this case to get better knowledge of their understanding.

-\section{Observation}
+\subsection{Observation}
 Observation is used especially within social anthropology. This type of observation is a set of methods where the researcher participates, openly or hidden, in people's daily lives in a given period of time\cite{tjora2012kvalitative}. In the same way observation can be used in a certain context. The goal of observation is often to see with your own eyes what happens to a person or group in a given situations or under certain circumstances. According to \tcite{thagaard2003systematikk} observation is particularly suited to give information about people's behavior and how they interact with each other, thus it is a good option to measure cooperation. 
 
 \bigskip\noindent
 Observation can be used as the only method in an experiment, but can be, and is often, used as a supplement to other methods. We distinguish between open and hidden observation and spectator, partially participating or completely participating observation. In hidden observation the researcher is present and observing, without the observee being informed of this. The advantage of this type of observation is that the participants don't get influenced and change their behavior as a result of being observed. The downside may be ethical issues and considerations. The difference between non-participating and participating observation is well illustrated by the difference in observing a handball match as a player or spectator. 
 
-\section{Interview}
+\subsection{Interview}
 Interview is used in situations where you want to study meaning, attitude and experience\cite{tjora2012kvalitative}. According to \tcite{thagaard2003systematikk} interview is particularly well used to give information about a person's experience, point of view and self understanding. In an interview situation the researcher often tries to create a relaxed atmosphere, so that the interview resembles a normal conversation revolving around some chosen topics. During the conversation the researcher leads the conversation by asking open or closed questions. The goal is often to get the interview object to talk as freely as possible. In this way it becomes clear what the interview subject means. Their attitudes and experiences comes forward.

We get to understand their thought process and understand what they have actually misunderstood and understood and not just misinterpreted.

 Questionnaires are in general considered a quantitative method. \tcite{ringdal2001enhet} writes that a questionnaire is a systematic method to collect data from a sample of people. This is done to give a statistical description of the population the sample is collected from. The questionnaire is standardized, which means that everyone get the same questions asked in the same way.

 Experiment is the classical scientific design in science, but it is also used in medicine and in social science under different names. In our case we call it experiment, in other cases it is called trial or intervention \cite{ringdal2001enhet}. In an experiment the researcher controls the difference between two treatments, X and Y, by deciding when the experimental group should be exposed to X. Control of other factors are secured through randomization. This gives a good foundation for explaining cause and effect. In social science, experiments cannot be performed in such a controlled way. It is impossible to control all the factors that can influence a person or group. But some sorts of experiments can still give valuable knowledge which is difficult to attain through other methods.

+\section{Data collection}
 In order to assess the learning gains accomplished by the students in angle and turn measurement estimation, a pretest-posttest design was used. The pretest was administered one week before the first session, and the posttest was administered an hour after the second session. The tests were individual and the students were not allowed to cooperate. Both tests were administered by the teacher. The other advantages and disadvantages of robots identified in section \ref{sec:whatAdvantage} was measured based on qualitative observations and quantitative results obtained by means of a post activity questionnaire.

We got inspiration from \citeauthor{clements2001logo}. They tested similar concepts, and the programming language they used was LOGO. In this research they have created several tests to measure geometry learning gains. These tests have been used in several projects before us.

 The inspiration behind the study was a wish to test the robot as an educational tool in an experimental classroom setup. We wished to increase students' understanding of angles and their angle estimation skills. We also wished to increase the students' cooperation and motivation. As we mentioned in chapter~\ref{chap:constructionism}, the pedagogic theory we rely on is constructionism, which is quite different from the blackboard and task driven mathematics education, which according to \tcite{alseth2003endringer} happens in most of the classrooms in Norway. When we talked to the teacher at THIS, it seemed like this is the prevalent method there as well.

+\section{Participants}
 To analyze our research questions, we tested the robots with a group of fifth-grade students from the international school in Trondheim(THIS). A group of fifteen students (four boys and eleven girls) was selected from a class of twenty to participate in the experiment. Three of the twenty students was on vacation during the experiment period. Two of the twenty did a full score on the pretest and their approach to the problems, as described in the depth questions, were perfect. We therefore concluded that our activities could not teach them anything new. The teacher also suggested that we don't include these two students. She meant that if they were in the group their ideas and help would dominate the learning gains of the students. Since we want to test the robot activity's ability to teach students the material, these students might interfere with the results. From these fifteen only eleven were able to participate on both sessions. 
 %It turned out that if we included them, there would not be enough tablets for every group anyways, so these students were dropped from the study as well, leaving a total of 15 students. 
 All the students were in the same class and either ten or eleven years old. They had been taught about angles one month prior to our experiment, using a traditional blackboard based teaching scheme. Thus every student had prior knowledge of angles and angle estimation. The next thing they were going to learn was about reflex angles and area of shapes. None of the students had worked in this experimental manner before or worked with this specific kind of technology before.

 The study was divided into two sessions, one held on a Friday and one on the following Monday. The first session lasted forty minutes and the second session lasted fortyfive minutes. 
 One of the groups had to use a phone instead of a tablet due to unavailability of one tablet. 
 The only difference of our application when used on a phone compared to a tablet is a smaller screen, and it did not seem to make a difference, at least not on the robot group, as they don't use the simulator, which is the part requiring a larger screen. Each session consisted of a short review of what they were supposed to learn, followed by a set of 10 difficulty increasing robot exercises. In the first session there was also a short introduction of about four minutes explaining how the the software worked.

 Other than this the students received no external help or instruction. The exercises of the first session were relatively easy, since their main purpose was for the students to familiarize with the technology. The exercises was designed so that everyone should be able to do something, but no one should be able to do everything. Only open polygons, or paths, where you don't end up where you started, were used in the first lecture exercises. This was done so that students would not get caught up in the precision of the robot or the length of movement.
