\section*{Abstract}
	In the later years robotics has seen a huge increase within domestic use, and have now become an affordable tool in the daily life of most people.
	The goal of this thesis is to look into how robotics can be combined with the early education of children in K-12, 
	in order to motive learning and generate more interest within the STEM fields.
