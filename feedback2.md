1. More specific title
2. abstact: clearify, pauline didnt understand it was a comparison between the two groups
3. Endre fra parts to chapters
4. ch2 should be in ch2 since its a very small chapter. additional sections should be converted to paragraphs
5. StateOfTheArt: are you doing a proper evaluation, should not use questions in headers
6. ch7 should be a section concluding the state of the art
7. ch1 - Introduction
	1. Rewrite the first two sentences to not offend teachers, but highlight pedagogical issues
	2. Paragraph 2 - fix type
	3. Merge with previous paragraph to avoid duplication(break new water etc.)
	4. Merge 1.2 with 1.1 as both in fact talk about motivation.
	5. 1.2 Should end in another way, obiously?
8. ch2 - Research questions
	1. Paragraph 1 fix type
	2. Rewrite RQ1 so that it is not a yes/no question
9. ch3 - Process
	1. Highly unusal to split the literature review into process, and 3 other chapters. At least make the additions 3 chapter into one. 
	2. Pauline fails at basic english. But should probably make it more explicit. 
	3. Make sure statements as "little discussion about reliability and validity" are discussed in the literature review if you want to include it in the summary.
	4. 3.2 Some duplication again, try to merge
	5. 3.3 should not be a separate section 
	6. 3.5 Reword not to offend anyone, last section should also be rewritten
10. ch5 - Process (again??)
	1. confusing cause the chapter comes after a introduction to constructionism
	2. the method should come as early as possible because its boring. :P
11. ch6 - State of the art
	1. should be complete, and not refer to papers found outside of the review
	2. negative results (below table 6.1) must be explained more
	3. GPS skills :P OK
	4. 6.3 paragraph 3 "us had 3-4 pupils per"
	5. 6.3 paragraph 6 "therefor"
11. chapter10 - Software
	1. after table 10.1 "framwork that"
	2. last paragraph before fig 10.1 "as the project was coming to an end" deemed unnecessary
	3. after table 10.2 "there is a", and "location of bug"
12. chapter11 - Hardware
	1. "contraptions"
	2. 11.1 "witht the 3D printes"
13. chapter12 - Research methodology
	1. does not explicitly mention that we will use contructionism
14. chapter13 - Choice of method
	1. Seems like Pauline want a concluding section in the introduction
	2. Advantages to tests should not be writtes as it is super-easy. But rather draw focus on the difficulty of creating a good pedagogical sound test.
	3. type: "only test" "For example if a student did not understand the question due to language limitations"
	4. "test build on solid knowledge" - Some wierd comment I dont understand.
	5. 13.2 "given situations"
15. chapter16 - Procedure
	1. 16.1 and 16.2 is still very informal and needs to be changed.
16. chapter17 - Data collection
	1. reference to Clements et al.
	2. 17.1 again informal language
	3. type "we used the same tasks for both the pre and post test so we CAN look at differences"
	4. We obisouly need to make it very clear where the questions are before discussing them.
	5. Clearify how certain questions have multiple subtasks
	6. Question 5 - typo in second section (should not "think")
	7. 17.2 Explain how the observers acted as Pauline thinks this is important
	8. 17.3 Should be some reference to 6.2, and explaination of different factors
17. chapter18 - Reliability and validity
	1. Again mixing theory with our opinion, which makes it hard for the sensor to see what is ours.
	2. need references on inital sentence in 18.1
	3. Typo "construcys"
	4. 18.2 different types of validity needs references
	5. Make sure all theats listen in 18.2.1 are used in our own discussion(I think they are, but make sure)
	6. 18.3 typo "as is"
	7. 18.3 Second paragraph is a bit unclear when it comes to errors in estimations
	8. Citing reliability vales before discussing what the values are is pointless
	9. typo 18.3 paragraph 4 "then" should probably be "than"
	10. Effects need to be explained, in this case the the "learning effect"
	11. 18.3 testing effect, results could be due to confusing the participants.
	12. Analysing results before showing them. perhaps even the whole chapter should come after the analysis
	13. Diffusion between groups were very important and neeeds to be discussed more

18. chapter19 - Results
	1. Too chatty it seems.
	2. "The overview tables are not needed anymore" - Pauline, "You must have overview tables" - Amali
	3. "all assumptions were cheked" === "trust me I know what I'm doing" === Very bad :P

19. chapter20 - Independent-samples t-test
	1. typo before table 20.1 "must"
	2. Pauline really want us to include all the results in the report
20. chapter 24 - Observations
	1. typo in for paragraph "though, "
	2. What scientific outfall can we draw from this chapter?
	3. Needs a summary, with some conclusions etc.
